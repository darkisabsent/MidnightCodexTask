					<br>
					<h5> League of Legends (often abbreviated as LoL) is a popular multiplayer online battle arena
						(MOBA) video game developed and published by Riot Games. It was first released in October 2009
						and has since become one of the most popular and widely played video games in the world.

						In League of Legends, players assume the role of a "champion," each with unique abilities and
						characteristics, and participate in team-based matches against other players or AI-controlled
						teams. The game is played from a top-down perspective and is typically played in a 5v5 format,
						where two teams compete to destroy each other's Nexus, a structure located at their base.</h5>
